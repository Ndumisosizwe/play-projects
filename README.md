# MY PLAYGROUND

A general repo with general play code, this is where i play when learning a new framework, a new language, doing random stuff,
solving online problems, practising and improving my craft.

Anything i'm curious about, that requires me to write some code to understand it, i come here and starting writing code. When i'm reading books, watching tutorials etc....
