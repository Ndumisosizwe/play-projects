# MY PLAYGROUND

A general repo with general play code, this is where i play when learning a new framework, a new language, doing random stuff,
solving online problems, practising and improving my craft.

Anything i am curious about that requires me to write some code to understand, when i'm reading books, watching tutorials etc....
i come here and start writing code.
